Welcome! I'm currently taking an Angular course to improve my web development skills.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.9.

## Core Technologies

#### I am using the following technologies in this project:

- **Angular**: A front-end development framework maintained by Google.
- **TypeScript**: A JavaScript superset programming language that adds optional static typing.
- **HTML**: Markup language to structure application content.
- **CSS**: Stylesheets to style and customize the layout.

Thanks for checking out this project!! ðŸ˜Š

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
